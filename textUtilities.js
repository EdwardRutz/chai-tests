//Use TDD to write code testing a movie title to confirm it is formatted in the proper Title Case.
// Loop through titleCase words, do function then store them in titleCasedWords

/*************** TESTS ********************/
//Chai Tests using the BDD style with the expect method
//Chain together natural language assertions
//Assertions are listed from simplest to most extensive
//Break the title/string into several peices and create a test for each word in the title
